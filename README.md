# **Mini Project: Personal Portfolio Enhancement Project**

*Welcome to my Personal Portfolio Enhancement Project where I showcased my skills using HTML, Flexbox, and CSS! It includes:*

```
✅ A Home Page with my welcome message.
✅ An About Page where you can learn more things about me.
✅ A Resume Page displaying my education, work experience, and skills.
```

*As you explore my portfolio you can enjoy some of the following:*
```
✅ A keyframe animation, over my contact information, which smoothly transitions between colors.
✅ A cool hover transition on my profile picture where the picture scales to a bigger size.
✅ A nice shadow effect on my nav bar.

```
